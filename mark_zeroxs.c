/* This is written so that it may be called in blocks.
 * x is the signal whose zero crossings you want to find
 * N is the length of x
 * uc is the container for the upward crossings if MZX_GROUP_CROSSINGS is set and
 * MZX_SEARCH_BACKWARD is set
 * dc is the container for the downward crossings if MZX_GROUP_CROSSINGS is set,
 *  whereby uc will be the container for the upward crossings. If
 *  MZX_SEARCH_BACKWARD is set but MZX_GROUP_CROSSINGS is not set then all the
 *  crossings will be put in this array. 
 * side is the side to start on. 1 is the positive side, 0 the negative.
 * x_l is the last non-zero sample of the previous, if run for the first time,
 *  set this to x
 * maxnc is the maximum number of crossings to find. Once this many have been
 *  found, the function returns.
 * opt can contain a bitwise-or of the following defines
 *   MZX_GROUP_CROSSINGS -> groups crossings into two sets as explained above,
 *    dc must be a valid array.
 *   MZX_NO_FINAL_NULL   -> doesn't set the final index of uc and dc to NULL.
 *   MZX_SEARCH_BACKWARD -> assumes x is a pointer to the last address of an
 *                          array and searches backward for zero-crossings. Note
 *                          that when going backward, what would have been an
 *                          upward going zero-crossing is now a downward going
 *                          zero-crossing. This is compensated for so that the
 *                          upward going and downward going zero crossing
 *                          containers always contain addresses that would be
 *                          classified as upward or downward going in the
 *                          positive direction. For example, if searching
 *                          backward, the next sample looked at is positive and
 *                          the previous sample looked at was negative, this
 *                          looks like an upward going zero crossing, but when
 *                          searching in the positive direction this would have
 *                          been classified as a negative going zero crossing.
 *                          This will be classified as a negative going zero
 *                          crossing even when we are searching backward.
 * the uc and dc containers must be large enough to hold all the zero crossings. */
